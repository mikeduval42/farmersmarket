Will they have the dried persimmons that you have been craving all week, what is in season, are they bringing anything new? Farmer's Market App is a site that allows vendors to update customers on what will be available at the next farmerâ€™s market.

The app utilizes Ruby on Rails, MongoDB, and Heroku.
